Been around this place for far too long
Some folks think I'm just hanging around
They say I just don't care
I gotta get away from here

But I've been wrong I need some new ways
My friend we don't get along get along no more
Don't need nobody to tell me nothing
Gonna live life the way that I feel

Been as free as a bird that flies
Ain't no difference in day or night
I wanna be lord I wanna be
No one with responsibilty
But I've been wrong I need some new ways
My friend we don't get along any more
Don't need nobody to tell me nothing
I'm gonna live life the way I feel

Some say the train is full
My life's been a success
But stick around I've been a fool
I gotta make this trip my last
Oooo ooo yeah

Train, train, train go down the line
Never never never been on time
Take me down to the pit of dispear
Anywhere but away from here
Train train train your doing fine

Rollin' down on that dusty train
Hope we found what we have no yet
You will see time goes by
Many have been this way
